#Peer Code Review
##October 15, 2015
###Karen Li (kjl32) and Bridget Dou (bd82)

Bridget and I discussed ways to improve the TurtleScene class of my SLogo project. First she suggested that I use Canvas instead of Rectangle to represent the area where the Turtle moves. This will allow utilization of the GraphicsContext package for drawing images and polygons that represent the turtle's path. She also suggested refactoring to be able to add several tabs to a tabpane.
